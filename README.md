# Project theCycles

## Concepts.

I call it the next move! And what should be in the next move:

- Redesign the dataset with a cycle model.
- Using both tkinter and ttkboostrap as the GUI to code.
- Apply different models to process the cycle dataset generated.

### Examples
![sample_rawDataset_logr.png](sample_rawDataset_logr.png)

## Folders Instructions

- /learning # learning and coding in the same project which make it easier to set up packages
- /scripts # storing the main scripts
- /models # storing models
- /utils # storing utility scripts such as preprocessing and reading dataset, etc.

## Menu Design for theCycles project

### STATISTIC

This menu refer to the analysis functions using traditional statistic methods such as sum and mean.

- Monthly (Switch to statistic monthly page which is analysing monthly frequency data)
- Daily (Switch to statistic daily page which is analysing daily frequency data)

### DEEP LEARNING

This menu refer to analysis using deep learning neutral network including state of art encoder-decoder or transformer 
network applying to daily cycles.

- Simple Fully Connected Network
- Recurrent Neutral Network
- Encoder-Decoder network

### GENERATIVE

This menu refer to analysis function using the generative network which newly emerged amid the development of GPT3 or 4.
